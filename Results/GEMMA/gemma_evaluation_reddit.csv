"This actually happened a couple of years ago. I grew up in Germany where I went to a German secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). My school was named after Anne Frank and we had a club that I was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about Anne Franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, Hitler, the Third Reich and that whole Spiel. Basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. 

This was my last year at school and I already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. I was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. We start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about Anne Frank and the Third Reich? You'd be surprised how much they know. Anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. After the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. One group watches a short movie about Anne Frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. Then the groups switch. 

I'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and I take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. I'm going down the list when I come to the name Sandra (name changed). A kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in Germany, pipes up. 

Now keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). This being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for German standards) Bavaria, I was confused. I looked down at the list again making sure I had read the name right. Look back up at the kid. 

Me: ""You're Sandra?""

Kid: ""Yep.""

Me: ""Oh, sorry. *Thinking the kid must be from somewhere where Sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* Where are you from? I've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.""

The class starts laughing. Sandra gets really quiet. ""I am a girl..."" she says. Some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met Sandra. I feel so sorry and stupid. I get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. We watch the movie in silence. After the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place I apologised to Sandra. I felt so incredibly terrible, I still do to this day. Throughout the rest of the day I heard lots of whispers about Sandra. I tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip I had set in motion.

Sandra, if you're out there, I am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. I hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. Don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. I'm sorry I probably made that day hell for you. I'm sorry for my ignorance.

**TL;DR: Confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. Kids are mean. Sorry Sandra.**","summarize: This actually happened a couple of years ago.

"It was last October, but I'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  

After my mom died from cancer last year, I started looking for my estranged father.  I had only known him for a short time when I was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  I never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so I didn't push her for information about him.  I figured he didn't care about us.

I had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and I didn't have an address with which to search.  After her death, I felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that I have a beautiful little girl.  It felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.
I googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  I called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since I'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  It wasn't.

I had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  He told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  He said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  My mom was the best woman I've ever known).

So, we started talking and skyping.  We spent a lot of time learning about each other. Knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but I tried to believe that people can change for the better.  

He was exactly everything I needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  Eventually, I told him that I loved him after months of talking with him.  He was over-the-moon.

Fast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  This is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that I sound like an ass.  I say this because I don't have a precise reason or event that I can point to as to why I don't trust him.  Why he actually makes me really nervous.

My dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  He doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  He doesn't give personal space and, when I spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while I was sleeping.  He said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but I really felt uncomfortable with it.  I couldn't sleep and was so glad that I didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.

He also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  I said ""no"" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  It wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  
I've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  I have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  

During the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  I was so grateful for it that I kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  He actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if I cited my daughter and husband as reasons that I needed to chill with the phone.  He never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  He also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  

Again, I know people can change, but at this point, I find myself wanting less contact with him.  The idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  I don't want to hurt him, but I just can't trust him.  I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.

Thank you for reading and I sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very Happy Father's Day!

"So I had the brilliant idea to use Veet hair removal gel as the ol' danglies were in need of a trim and I had heard that Veet leaves them smoother for longer. Well I guess thats right when the skin has to grow back first. 

Pre-Story: I tried this before and the results were great but I had decided to do it again because of how well it worked. 

So I take out the gel/cream stuff and just lob it on and cover the forest. The slight peroxide kinda smell ensued and all was going well, there was a slight burning but thats to be expected, you know, melting pubes off does that. So comes the all and mighty time of scraping that stuff off, top half all good, no pain or anything. But, the danglies were what was burning, I scraped them and withstood the pain because well lets face it, men are men and a little pain for balls as smooth as jam jars is fine right? Wrong, it did great at taking the hair off it, but decided to take the first layer of skin too, my nuts now glow cherry red and walking is a painful expense that can't be justified.

"Today I was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival. All would go well, except being the genius I am, I put in some epsom salts (I always do for my bath), and I grabbed my bottle of peppermint essential oil.

 Lately, I've been on a diy-pinterest-tumblr-let's-make-my-own-shit-and-be-fancy spree. The other day I took a 'detox bath' (fyi did nothing for me guys. Uselessss). So, my brain totally went 'hey, trajectorys, put some peppermint in! It's good for your skin!' Okay brain!

So, instead of logically putting in like... 5 drops so it's nice and minty fresh smelling and just enough to work, I literally shook the thing full force all over the top of the bath water. I'm talking like... probably 50-100 drops. So I finish running the water, turn it off, and hop in.

First five minutes went really well.. And then the cold started. Okay, this is fine, it just is the peppermint cooling my skin. Brain is like, just wait it out. So I stayed in.

Ten minutes in and I'm moving back and forth trying to keep the warm water warm, if I stopped moving it was like sitting in the water at the foot of a glacier. So I sit up.

You know that feeling when you brush your teeth and drink ice water? That immense cold in your mouth? My back felt like that immediately. 

So now I'm sitting here and my back, my butt, and my ladybits are burning cold. Like, sitting in the snow naked kind of cold. It's really uncomfortable... So indeed, TIFU.

TL;DR: Peppermint + bath = burning cold ladybits.","summarize: Today I was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival.

"I haven't had a bath in practically years so, after finally moving into a house with a bath, I decide to have one. Having recently purchased a shiny new bag of weed, I thought combining the two would be a good idea.

Picture this; a very cramped bathroom, no windows, a shitty extractor fan, closed door, steaming hot bath and a spliff. As I lay there gently swishing to and fro, giggling like a little school girl, I neglected to notice how hot the room was becoming. 

After a while I looked up and realised I could barely even see the taps in front of me. Naturally, I begin to panic and started scrambling around trying to escape. I grabbed a towel, stood up and immediately fell back to the floor. All I could see was black for what felt like 5 minutes, my heart was pounding and I could feel the blood rushing past my ears.

Once the feeling passed I stumbled into my bedroom and stood in front of the mirror, facing me was an extremely red version of myself with a bleeding shoulder. 

Currently, my heart rate has almost returned to normal and I'm starting to feel and look less like a lobster. 2/10 would not recommend.

"This was like 2 and a half weeks ago maybe 3. So i left my house to meet up with my girlfriend at a spot in some sorta wood type thing near some nice houses. on my way i saw landscape workers working around the houses and cleaning.  i meet my gf and go find a spot in the woods. The spot we went to seemed nice and lonely for the both of us to hang out. I cant remember if we smoked or not (fried) but i was horny and I'm sure she was too so we start making out and start touching each other all over the place. Then we start having sex in the woods. We were having sex peacefully until we heard workers. They sounded far but every second they seemed to get closer.  We realized that they were just a few feet away.  quickly me And my gf got up and get dressed and  head over to a different spot which was not a good idea. We were kinda laying there and i told her that i wanted to finish, she said okay but she wanted to do it right there.I don't know what made me look back but when i do i see the landscapers and they were looking our way. There was about 3 or 4 workers. We quickly got off each other. I don't know for how long they were watching but they were watching. One kept looking our way. I was so embarrassed.

"So, my oven is broken...and I'm out of cooking oil, but I want some french fries. So I search the internet and find that if you cover french fries with something, either napkins or another plate and microwave them, they turn out ok. So I tried it, I took to plates, smushed em together and put the french fries in the microwave. (Don't try this at home) 
 Half way through the five minute cooking cycle I pull the plate out. Steam billowing out the crack between the two plates. I lift off the top plate and let it cool down a but, I touch the french fry and it's warm but a tad bit cold, I feel around and flip them with my fingers (Genius!) And then I reach the center of the plate. 
 Freeze frame, have you ever microwaved something, like chicken nuggets, and the nuggets near the edge of the plate are colder than the ones in the middle? Well this is exactly what happened, but a thousand times worse. Since the fries have been blanched, frozen, bagged, and then put into my freezer, that means there's still some oil in the fries, and the microwave brought out that oil and boiled it, 
 So I was poking around the fries when my finger squishes into a really soft one, right into the hell-fire center, where broiling hot potato smushes under my finger nail, I jump back in shock and flail around my hand whispering ""Ow, stop, Ow, stop, Ow, stop"" I cover the plate, start the microwave, and walk away, suddenly, this Burning sensation just erupts over the tip of my finger, full on pain train. I step into the bathroom and run it under cold water, only to find out. We're out of burn cream!

So now I'm sitting at my desk, with first degree burns on my index finger which I stuck in a bag of frozen corn

"This technically happened yesterday since it 1:30 am here, but I can't sleep because I'm worried. 

Before I start, let me set the scene. It's getting close to 6 on a mildly wet Western North Carolina summer day. Not too much rain, but enough to get the grass wet, and I'm in the really mountainous part of WNC. 

So anyway, after hanging out with a friend of mine, we decide to visit another friend at her house since we're nearby.  I pull up the driveway, see other friends' truck in the way, so I try to go around. The friend I was riding with got ""Wait there's a-"" out just as I heard a *thunk*. ""-ditch there."" Got-dang it Bobby. So I get out, lo and behold I'm stuck. If my truck had 4 wheel drive, I wouldn't have been as concerned. So I try to go further forward. I hear a *SNAP*. ""Well you broke my pipe, but that's fine."" Turns out I snapped a ~3 inch PVC pipe (I guess for drainage) and it was now lodged in front of my right front tire.

Now here's where it gets interesting.

I leave my truck in neutral, go out to look at the pipe. Think *Oh, I can get that out from under there.* When I do, the whole truck comes rolling forward (remember; mountain country, I'm stuck on a slope.) I dodge the truck, which hits the girl's barn. Neither the barn nor the truck was hurt, but I was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side. After reassuring everyone there I was A-okay, one of the girls called her cousin, who brought a Jeep and a chain. I wriggle my way out of the wire, ever-so carefully step over the wire to make sure I can still have both boys and girls, not just one or the other, and make my way over to help hook things up and such. 

Long story short, we get it uphill a little, get another truck involved, get it angled better, cut the fence, and I drive my truck down the adjacent field (what the fence was there to fence off), and everything is okay. I ended up with just as many scratches as the truck. I just got a text to call the girl's mom tomorrow, and I'm worried that she'll tear me a new butthole after this. 

Tl;dr- My truck went vroom vroom into a ditch. I tried to get it out, and it tried to kill me. After shouting ""Ole!"" and getting scratched up more than a husband having sex with a kinky cougar, two rednecks helped me out of a perilous predicament.

"Earlier today, I was at the local county fair in the lovely county of Adams in Wisconsin. I was there to enjoy the fair, help out and have a wonderful day. However, later in the afternoon, I found myself in the Rabbit, Chicken, Duck, Goose and Dairy Barn. I was behind a row of rabbit cages with my cousin, which bordered up to the wooden fence divider between the rabbits and dairy cows. 

This beautiful Heifer decided she wanted to poke her head through to the rabbit side  for what I thought, was to get a good scratch behind the ears, and on her bump. She however, had other thoughts. She was just interested in getting the bucket of water on the floor that was meant for watering the rabbits.

When I reached down to scratch her, she tolerated it for about 10-15 seconds. At the end of those few seconds, I was looking away speaking to my husband, son, and cousin. All of a sudden, a loud thwack and searing pain in my right hand. I looked down, and she had my hand squished in between her head/head bump and the wooden fence post in the barn. 

After I got my hand loose, about ten seconds after the initial hit, it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail, as well as the base of the nail was bleeding in the cuticle. My other finger nails felt like I had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can, then push your fingers together game. So as of right now, my hand is still in serious pain, the nail is purple and has some serious blood build up underneath it. As well, all the rest of the blood vessels in the top of my finger have burst so its about three times the size it should be. So this is how I screwed my hand up, by fucking up and mistaking a heifer's want for water, as the want for attention.

I had no choice though, but to walk; and of course, living the greater Seattle area, it started raining. It was a 25 minute walk, then a 30 minute bus-ride with runny crap between my cheeks. The only good news was that when I got to work, my underwear wasn't too badly stained.

"(Technically this is more of a Three Years Ago I Fucked Up, but I digress...)

Back in the good old school days, we had Friday sport. This term, myself and a group of friends decided to join the Representative Touch Footy team, and we were waiting for the bus to take us to our semi final match.
My friend was sitting on the side of the grassy hill where we were waiting, and yelled ""Oi, come over here!"" and patted her lap.

So, naturally I went over and jumped into her lap, in a weak attempt to crush her legs. Much laughing ensued, which attracted the attention of our other friends. So, we ended up in a pile of about 10, resembling a pile of stacked-up chairs.

One of my teachers noticed, and walked over to us, shaking his head slightly. Of course, what is the most natural response to seeing a stack of people sitting in each others laps? Push the stack.
So, with eight people in front of me (with some pretty serious weight adding up there), we fell over sideways.

As the laughter increased tenfold, I heard a very faint clicking sound. Feeling my leg tense up, I looked down. Bad move.

About five centimetres to the right of my leg was my knee cap, hanging (or levitating as it appeared from my angle) in midair.

So, after a number of very unladylike expletives and a bit of yelling/screaming, people noticed that my knee cap had attempted to escape my leg and called an ambulance. 
Then the bus showed up.

So, while my friends went to sport and got their asses kicked by a fellow high school, I sat on the side of the hill with my fucked up leg.
The paramedics show up, and ask if they can try and put my knee cap back in place without pain killers. At this point, the extremely light spring breeze which is flowing feels like razor blades cutting into my tendons, so I wasn't exactly keen on this idea.

So, they picked up the end of my leg and pulled.

I think I punctured an eardrum, screaming. 

They realise that this might not be the best plan, so I'm bundled up onto a stretcher and head off to hospital. Driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list, but at least I've crossed it off?

When I arrive at the hospital, I'm finally given the good pain killers (Nitrous oxide for the win, none of that ""Green Whistle"" shit) and the ER physio walks in. It took three people to stabilise me, while he pulled my foot and twisted. Behold, my knee cap FINALLY pops back in! They waited for me to come down of the high of the nitrous before fitting me in a knee brace and crutches.

Note for the wise - a knee brace which holds your leg completely straight, thus making one leg longer than the other, will fuck you over. Worst two weeks ever.

After a month, with crutches, a knee brace and some really pleasant taping, physiotherapy and an inability to climb stairs easily, my knee was finally released from its self-induced prison.

I've never sat in that friend's lap again. I also got an A in Geography from that teacher at the end of that term.

"**WARNING!: WALL OF TEXT WHICH COULD EASILY BE VIEWED AS REALLY FUCKING BORING**

The background of the relationship is that we had met online and hadn't met yet. He lives 200 miles away from where I live, but my life's rather busy and he doesn't have a job right now (unemployment in his region is over 50%, so I don't blame him). He's a very kind, sweet human being, and I probably would have been lucky to end up with him. Now, I'm not from the country I'm currently studying in, but I would like to end up here eventually. It seemed that the stars had aligned in showing me that there was hope for love here… Boy, was I wrong.

There's a huge secessionist movement within a different region (one which neither of us live in), which has been gaining traction over the years, especially with the recent economic collapse. I am a lover of said region; it's the place where I feel the most comfortable in the entire world — the people, the cuisine, the culture… all of it just *fits*.

He, however, does not feel the same way about this region. I already knew that, but it had been bothering me since he had called people from there ""obnoxious sheeps [sic]"", amongst other things. We have always had different communication styles (I'm a fucking loudmouth and he's rather reserved), but we had been making it work. This morning, however, I couldn't hold back some of my worries, and amongst other things, I mentioned how he wants to live in an entirely different country and how I would not.

The **tl;dr** would be that **he effectively told me I should live in a region he hates and I admire because I clearly don't understand the political climate — in so many words, we should break things off.** However, it's much deeper than that. Apparently, half his family is from said region (and it's the half he dislikes, of course), and he had lived there a very brief period of time. Despite all that, apparently he had never had a bad time there and no one ever did any harm to him. So I really couldn't figure out what his beef was with this place that has always seemed so charming to me.

I don't know what else to say, really. I debated with him my point as best as I could, calling out flaws in his argument about the nature of the secessionist movement and the national identity of the people from that region. For a while I thought he could at least be tolerant of my deep regard for it but… it would appear that even that was impossible. I got fed up with his ad hominem attacks on me and on the people who live out there, and I told him he can act like a child all he likes, but it doesn't make a whole group of people terrible just for their geographical location.

Tbph, I'm a bit numb to it all. In January I had a whirlwind romance which tore me to pieces by the end of it. And having this happen without ever even meeting to see if we're compatible in the real world… Welp, I'm just done with men for a while. I don't feel anything and my only reaction to this whole thing was to clean my room and wash my sheets in a fervor. He apparently felt awful that he'd lost my respect, but rather I deleted him from all of our sources of communication, which I did so I wouldn't have to deal with his remorse.

I'm not sure if I really fucked up today but… it would have been nice to at least have *tried* to make things work instead of leaving things off on such a sour note.

"I had my electronics class today and my professor gave us an assignment where we have to make something from nothing. Nothing being the broken computers and other electronics that we could find in our workroom. 

My group decided to build a boat, because honestly, hot gluing a block of styrofoam to a CPU fan is the easiest idea that any of us could think of, but we wanted to get a bit more creative. We found a couple of speakers in an old bin, and one with the audio output still intact with an auxiliary headphone cable, so we decided to play around with them a bit and see if we could mount them on our boat. 

Before we began work on them, we had to see that they worked, so I took the speaker with the intact audio output, plugged it into my phone, hooked up the speaker to the oscillator, kicked it up to five volts, and started playing a song on my phone.

Little did I know that the current would travel through the speaker, up the auxiliary cable, into my phone's audio input where the battery beyond had a maximum load capacity of only three point eight volts. 

I literally held my phone in my hands as the voltage fried my motherboard and the screen turned black, never to turn on again.

"This was actually a few weeks ago, but over the course of my relationship with my girlfriend we have shared quite a lot of intimate texts between each other.

A few days later, my phone uploads the recent backup of my texts, and my brother sees it. Since it had a weird file name, he opened it to make sure it wasn't some virus. Sure enough, the first text he sees is the beginning of a sext from my girlfriend, going into much detail about how we want to fuck each other and how horny we are.

"Well it wasn't today but rather last night.... After a few drinks and a blunt (we are both ents), my boyfriend and I decided to ""do the dirty"" since its been a few days. We were getting really into it when he decides he wants to do anal again. I'm not a big fan but we have done it before and he knows to be gentle so I said why not. I'm pretty sure he was on e too because he lasted way longer than normal and he was going pretty fast when we switched it up. After telling him a few times to slow down because it hurt, he switched back to good old vaginal intercourse from behind. Well, here is where the Fuck up happened. Any of you ladies who have done anal are probably aware of that ""poopy feeling"" after, so of course that was happening. He was still going in from behind, so I decided to stick my butt up and arch my back down because it drives him insane, when all of a sudden I felt a fart rumbling through.....then it happened. Though, It was more than a fart. We both stopped and I asked sheepishly if there was a mess, he said no then promptly ran to the bathroom. I heard the shower go on and that's when I knew he was just trying to not make a big deal of it. 

When he came out of the shower I ran in the bathroom almost in tears and showered as well. I came back out and didn't even want to say anything, I was horrified. He assured me it was ok and that we would pretend it never happened, and all night and all day he was being a lot nicer than usual knowing that although I'm not embarrassed by much at all, when I am embarrassed, i don't take it lightly.

"Ok so first off i would like to say its not funny till the end so prepare to be like ""o shit"" and then ""is this ever going to end"" but enjoy.
 So i was going downstairs about 2 hours ago to get something to eat and possibly to drink. While downstairs i notice my mother eating a salad, and naturally i was like fuck yea salad i love me some salad. upon investigation of the refrigerator I notice that there isn't any salad left. (btw fuck you grammer nazi's because i dont care about my punctuation) I decide that im going to be crafty...so i grab it and sneak behind my mother and yell loudly that i was the salad ninja and stole a bite. Now as this happens she turns and looks at me with dissapointment  in her eyes as she yells ""stay off my fu-......."" and at that moment she looks up at me and gasps that she cant breathe and needs help. so i do what i think the fucking Heimlich maneuver is, which wasnt pretty at all, and fail horribly and start yelling for her to breathe because it was all i could think to do and this woke my step-dad. at this moment i realized she was coughing which means she was breathing to some extent. my stepdad rolls in the kitchen and tries to pull off his version of the Heimlich maneuver as well which also wasnt pretty at all. and after some trial and error he looks at me realizing she is breathing as well sort of saying ""what the hell are we in here doing as far as i know shes fine."" then he looks back down at her only to look up again and stare into my eyes as if he is looking at my soul or something for at least 15 seconds which felt like a year or something. then my wife comes down the stairs and she starts freaking out and calls the ambulance and i realize why she was shocked as i saw the puddle of blood coming from my mothers mouth. The squad showed up and they asked questions like her name and other various things a squad would ask before packing her up in the gurney and rolling out to the hospital. my step-dad left shortly after and i havnt seen or heard from them yet. Although i had a terrible realization just a few minutes ago...

I would like to start off by saying that my step-fathers half mexican daughter is coming to ohio tomorrow to see her father for the first time in her life. (she is 29 years old) So tomorrow is a very special day, but just like the dumbass idea of salad ninja i decided to be an ass again and do something even more stupid. I decided that since she is part mexican she must be catholic right? riiiiiiiiiiiiiight. So i also think who is the biggest catholic ever....Muffuckin hitler. So since i was going to be the first person she sees at 10 AM tomorrow morning i thought i would shave my head and all of my facial hair except for a hitler mustache and completely act like it was normal and this is how i look all the time. 

Of course i forget about this completely as it was several hours before and no one else had known about it. This also made me realize that the 15 seconds my step-dad stared into my soul was actually the 15 seconds my step-dad was wondering why in the fuck does this dumbass have a fucking hitler mustache. As i have said i hadnt talked to anyone about it and no one knew anything about it, nor have i talked to anyone since it happened and im sure im going to hear about his when they all get home. Im not really sure how to explain a hitler mustache to anyone, if anyone has ideas im open for them.

I get into position and angle everything towards her neck so it can easily be cleaned up afterwards. And then it happened. I ejaculated. But, it took this mysterious unexplainable angle. And it was as if time slowed down so as to allow me to watch every last moment of what was happening. Instead of going straight out and to her neck, it went up and it had this stunning arching angle that ended up landing right straight in the middle of her eye. That's right, I came right in her eye with an angle that would not allow me to do that!

That is when I started uncontrollably laughing while I was straddling her body which caused my penis to bounce up and down in front of her face and smacking bouncing on her chest.

"I went on a road trip to visit my mom last week. It was my first time driving to NYC. My map app told me that it was a toll road so I pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty. I'm from the midwest and I've never paid a toll that was higher than maybe $4. I've made the drive up I95 as far north as Baltimore all the way down to GA and I knew there weren't any tolls until I went under the harbor and that one was only a few bucks. I felt prepared.

I pay a couple of tolls totaling $12 and now I'm on the Jersey turnpike. I glanced at my ticket and assume that the $8 I have left should cover my toll just fine. I have not actually zoomed out of my route at all and have just been trusting the map to tell me where I'm going. 

Turns out it doesn't even matter because I get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the EZ pass. I don't have one. There's no way to back up or turn around. Cars are honking at me because I'm pretty much panicking at this point. My kids are in the car asking me what's going on and I have no choice but to go forward and hope that I'm not committing a felony or something. 

From there on it's rapid fire exits and the start of intense traffic going into the city. There's no place to pull over and pull more cash, nor did it even occur to me to do so because by now I'm no longer on an Interstate. However, a few miles down the road and there's another tollbooth and they want $12, which, of course, I don't have because nothing in my years of Interstate travel through middle America has prepared me for how much tolls are on the East Coast. She waves me through and I feel like crying. I have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as I did then. 

Fast forward to today and I get a bright orange envelope in the mail. It's an EZ pass citation. Not only do I owe them $13 (!) for the toll, but I'm charged an extra $50 as a fine. I'm praying that the other toll I owe doesn't have the same fee added to it. 

Ironically enough, on the way home I accidentally picked a route consisting of state roads and didn't realize it at first. I literally paid $3 in tolls and shaved 2 hours off the trip by avoiding backed up metro traffic. But guess who had $150 in my purse just waiting for a tollbooth to materialize on the horizon?

TL;DR Gas to get from GA to NY round trip was around $200. Tolls and citations will probably end up being over half that.

It was my first time driving to NYC. My map app told me that it was a toll road so I pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty.

"Okay, so I just got off work today and I had to tell this story somewhere. I work in a call center for a cable company for their tech support. Today I got a specific call about something along the lines of ""When I open internet explorer all that comes up is a giant white screen and I can never close out of the pages""

At first I thought, maybe he hit f11 and it cause the browser to go full screen. In the end I figured out he was actually using the new windows 8 operating system and just didn't know how to navigate it whatsoever. I'm not an expert on windows 8 by any means, but I thought I would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out even though it was out of my support boundaries. This guy was bounced from line to line and no one was willing to help him, so why wouldn't I make his day just a bit better by doing him this one favor?

Well, for one, this guy was a bit strange. He was an older man, and 5 minutes into the call he let me know ""how beautiful of a voice"" I have. Asked me my age and where I'm located (basically any information I was allowed to give out.) He repeated my name multiple times and just kept talking about how pretty my voice apparently is on the phone. I didn't think much of it, until we got to me showing him how to use his OS. 

Over the phone I talked him through typing in an address in the actual address bar at the bottom of the page on windows 8 and prompted him to type in a code which would allow me to remotely access his computer and navigate it/type stuff on it/use a highlighter/etc in order to show him how to use the computer. First things first, let's delete all those open tabs..

Lucky me I guess, half those tabs were porn. Straight up porn. My favorite had to have been the ""daddy daughter massage play"". Definitely had me rethinking those questions I answered earlier in the call. Anyways, when The tabs opened I heard him on the other line say ""Oh, hello there!"" and I about died laughing. 

The rest of the call was super awkward, and now I'm pretty sure I have a phobia of old men calling me for technical support. But at least it's over. 

tl;dr tried helping someone with a problem even though it was out of my realm of support and ended up looking at multiple pages of an elderly man's porn, then had to close it out for him because he didn't know how.

"Technically it was not today but last friday, hope you forgive me there. Also, forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker.

  So I´m a nervous guy,and this week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because I had to buy some groceries on my apartment that I didn´t account for. Now, I dont have a debit card so I can't get money from my savings that easily. So naturally I don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and I try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money, which I end up missmanaging, and by friday morning I had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it. As I was pretty much bankrupt and I had to attend to some classes saturday morning, I give up and end up asking my parents to send me money. At this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt I am and how likely it is that money wont come on time and I´ll find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning, so I was not paying attention while I took the bus back home.

The bus drivers where I live are pretty much insane, and policemen apparently dont care about this, so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100km/h instead of 40km/h. In this moment I realize I will miss my stop, and there are no set stops for the bus on my country, outside of the capital city, so I yell at the guy to stop, of course he can´t go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street. The guy slows down to 30km/h by the moment he gets to my stop, and I for some reason thought I could be a badass and jump/run out of the bus whithout fall damage cause well, my mind was all over the place about money, so I jumped from a moving bus, at 30km/h and the inevitable happens, I wreck my ankle like a total dumbass, and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth, in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows. Out of pure shame I stand up and signal them that I'm ok and walk all the way to my apartment (approx 200m plus straircases) I lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit.

Fast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon (a small melon), and I can't bear the pain. Luckily this is also the moment that my cousin (who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me) gets to the apartment so I ask him to get me to the hospital. Long story short, I had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be, which earns me a cast, a $300 bill with my cousin, and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors I end up owing exams, and to my already pissed parents.

TL;DR: Jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months.","summarize: Technically it was not today but last friday, hope you forgive me there.

"So, I was playing Halo 4 at my friends house. We played like 5 matches, and I had been doing horribly.

We start up a game of free for all and we get at it. Intense game. Last 20 seconds and im tied with my friend who is sitting there split screening with me. I win by a kill.

Herrs where I fuck up. I get so excited and all of us are cheering that I kick the Xbox over. It makes a weird humming noise and we wait like 10 seconds before unplugging it.

He pops out the disc, and shit, its scratched. Its now unreadable. I had to give him my copy. Fuck.

TL;DR: Im a loser at Halo, win once, freak out, kick xbox, scratch disc, have to give him mine.","summarize: So, I was playing Halo 4 at my friends house.

"ok, sigh. this happened last night.

my friend, brother and i went to go watch a movie at a local theatre. im getting over a stomach flu so ive been passing gas lately, sorry for the TMI. so we find a parking spot and i thought it would be funny to rip a huge one before we leave to see if the smell would still stay in the truck until after the movie, i really didnt need to so i tried to force one out! and boom... a BIG ASS SHART!!! i had the most embarrassing face on, my friend and brother asked me what was wrong and i told them what happened, and they were literally ROFL. we were late for the movie because i had to take a pitstop at starbucks bathroom.

i took me a good 25 minutes to wipe up, throw away my boxers, and do anything else to clean myself up. i couldnt do anything about the smell tho. and when i was done, i opened the door and there was a line of people waiting for the bathroom. :/ FML

TL;DR i forced a shart, cleaned up and stunk up a starbucks bathroom, and watched a movie COMMANDO.","summarize: ok, sigh. this happened last night. my friend, brother and i went to go watch a movie at a local theatre. im getting over a stomach flu so ive been passing gas lately, sorry for the TMI. so we find a parking spot and i thought it would be","i forced a shart, cleaned up and stunk up a starbucks bathroom, and watched a movie commando.",0.2388059701,0.06153846154,0.1194029851,-0.05903575942,0.03383939341,-0.01138770767,-0.1613,-0.6808,0.5195
